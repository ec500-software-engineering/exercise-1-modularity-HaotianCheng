We assume that we have all three sensors( Pulse, Blood Pressure, Blood Oxygen) which provide numbers with fixed unit (Pulse: /min, Blood Pressure: mmHg, Blood Oxygen: %) to the input in order every min.
We also want to have the patient name and ID in our input given by the doctor at the beginning.
All possible errors will be handled after the input being given every min. For example: if one of our sensors is broken which provides nothing or mojibake, our input will find it out and provide corresond information as output.
